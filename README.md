#Distributed File System

The purpose of this project is to implement a DFA that uses absolutely no memory other than the functions argument. It's just a simple exercise. The trick is to use labels. The dfa has the following specifications: 

1. The input of a function is a binary number. 
2. The output is “accept” if the binary number is equal to 1 mod 3, and “reject” otherwise.
3. The function should use only one variable i that ranges from 1 to n, where n is the length of the input. 

The DFA was reversed due to the limitation (or lack of creativity) of only being able to read the input backwards.
